# Implementation of Smoothed particle Hydrodynamics, Shape Matching, and Monodomain using CUDA

A 3D implementation of "A velocity correcting method for volume preserving viscoelastic fluids." [1], using the Shape Matching [2] velocity correction scheme. For now, it is using the SPH algorithm presented by Müller et al.[5], instead of IISPH [3]. Will most likely implement Divergence-free SPH [4] since it requires less memory than IISPH, as well as being more stable. Using CUDA to speedup the SPH calculations.
